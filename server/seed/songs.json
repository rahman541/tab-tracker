It's pretty much the same as the verse except with distortion\nand I lined it up with the chorus tabs above so you can tell the timing between\nthe two parts, but it's pretty easy to figure out by ear. Also, this isn't\nplayed in the Bridge, only Guitar 1 is.\nD#|-------7*--------12*----12*-------7*---------12*---|\nA#|-7*----------7*-------------7*----------7*---------|\nF#|-----------5*-------------------------5*-----------|\nC#|---------------------------------------------------|\nG#|---------------------------------------------------|\nC#|---------------------------------------------------|\n\nEnd\nD#|--------|\nA#|--*7----|\nF#|--------|\nC#|--------|\nG#|--------|\nC#|--------|\n\n\nPiano Parts Converted To Guitar\n\nMain Riff\nD#|----------------|\nA#|----------------|\nF#|---44-----------|\nC#|-2-----5-44445--|\nG#|----------------|\nC#|----------------|\n\nOutro\nD#|------------------|\nA#|---------5--7-8-7-|\nF#|------------------|\nC#|-2-4-5------------|\nG#|------------------|\nC#|------------------|"
